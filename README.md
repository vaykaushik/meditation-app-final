A meditation app with three stages.

Basic meditation app with three stages.

The web app can be viewed here:

This app consists of 3 stages.

1. Breathe in.
2. Hold.
3. Breathe out.

This was achieved via CSS @keyframe animations where I started off with specifying the times according to what class names were given i.e. 'grow' and 'shrink'. Then within Javascript, I added setTimeout methods for the classes to be changed at the right time within a function called 'breatheAnimation'.

A demonstration is shown below as a GIF:
